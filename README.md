Hi, I did a project in sql. I downloaded a data from kaggle dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings. Uploaded the dataset on postgresql and answered 10 questions out of the dataset. So what did i do basically- I updated data on the databases, stored and communicated with it.
